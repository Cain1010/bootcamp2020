## Welcome to Python Bootcamp 2020

Everything you need to successfully learn something from the workshop can be found on this website. 

Our goal is to give you a basic understanding of the structure of Python, what it can be used for, and provide with you the tools you need to learn anything else you might need. 

### Agenda
```markdown
- Day 1

- Day 2

- Day 3

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/python-bootcamp-ucd/bootcamp2020/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
